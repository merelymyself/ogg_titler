# ogg_titler

Have you ever downloaded more than 500 .ogg files in a totally legal manner to add to your music playlist, only to find that they lack a title?
Has that ever irked you so much such that you wished there was a tool to ensure you didn't have to manually assign titles to them?
Fear no longer!
ogg_titler is a shellscript that lets you set titles to any amount of .ogg files!
What's special about ogg_titler?
- Saves you 5 minutes
- Maybe buggy
- It took me 45 minutes to work out why it was not working (it was a typo)

For instance, let's say you have a file directory, ~/Music, with the following files: 
"a.ogg b.ogg c.ogg"

\> ./ogg_titler.sh ~/Music

Presto! Your ogg files are now titled 'a', 'b' and 'c' respectively and will show up under those names in music players!
